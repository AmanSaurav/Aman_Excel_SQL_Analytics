# Aman_Excel_SQL_Analytics

Hi, if you have stumbled here, then welcome to my data portfolio!

I am Aman Saurav, a graduate of IIT Delhi. I am a major data nerd, along with being an in-general-nerd as well. I love all things computers literacy, CLI Tools, making educational content in computers and chemistry as well as finding patterns in data!

I have made top selling courses on LaTeX, Chemistry, commandline tools and I have no intention of stopping! :)

This is the place where I have stored all of my previous work regards to Data Analytics for others to review and enjoy and learn!

This involves a lot of Excel, mySQL, LaTeX, Python, Tableau, PowerBI among other stuff!

Cheers!
